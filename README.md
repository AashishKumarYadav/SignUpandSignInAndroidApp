# SignUpandSignInAndroidApp
I developed a secure and user-friendly Login and Signup Android Application using Kotlin and Firebase Database. This application allows users to effortlessly create accounts through the SignUp Activity and log in directly with the SignIn Activity. To enhance user experience, I implemented explicit intents for seamless navigation between screens and used toast messages to provide immediate feedback, such as a 'Registered' message upon successful registration. Additionally, I incorporated a visually appealing Splash Screen for a polished app launch experience.
